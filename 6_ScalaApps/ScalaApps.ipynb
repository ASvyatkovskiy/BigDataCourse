    "# Model selection via cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task in ML is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for a given task. **Pipelines** facilitate model selection by making it easy to tune an entire **Pipeline** at once, rather than tuning each element in the **Pipelines** separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, **spark.ml** supports model selection using the **CrossValidator** class, which takes an Estimator, a set of ParamMaps, and an Evaluator. CrossValidator begins by splitting the dataset into a set of folds which are used as separate training and test datasets; e.g., with k=3 there is 3 folds, CrossValidator will generate 3 (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing. CrossValidator iterates through the set of ParamMaps. For each ParamMap, it trains the given Estimator and evaluates it using the given Evaluator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluator can be a RegressionEvaluator for regression problems, a BinaryClassificationEvaluator for binary data, or a MultiClassClassificationEvaluator for multiclass problems. The default metric used to choose the best ParamMap can be overriden by the setMetric method in each of these evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ParamMap which produces the best evaluation metric (averaged over the k folds) is selected as the best model. CrossValidator finally fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates using CrossValidator to select from a grid of parameters. To help construct the parameter grid, we use the ParamGridBuilder utility.\n"
