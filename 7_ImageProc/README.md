# Image processing with Thunder (on the laptop)

To get started, change into the exercise directory, make sure you are in the Anaconda environment (in case you restarted your laptop or opened a different terminal window):

```bash
cd BigDataCourse/7_ImageProc
source activate <your_conda_env>
pip install --user thunder-python
```

Re-start the notebook:

```bash
IPYTHON_OPTS="notebook" $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark
```
