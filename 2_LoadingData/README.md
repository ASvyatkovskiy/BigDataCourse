In this section, we will explore loading basic data types into RDDs and Dataframes.

We are going to need to restart the Spark-enabled jupyter notebook to load a third-part `spark-csv` library from Databricks:

```bash
#cd BigDataCourse/2_LoadingData
pyspark --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.5.0
```
