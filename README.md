#Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark

## Pre-exercises

The pre-exercises are intended to build some domain knowledge in the fields covered during the course. 
The notebooks cover web-mining (scraping), NLP and text processing, machine learning (kNN) and some modern data structures (Pandas DataFrame). Each of these pre-exercises is supposed to be completed on the laptop and does not require cluster access or Apache Spark installed.

These are the topics that will be discussed during the main course at scale.
