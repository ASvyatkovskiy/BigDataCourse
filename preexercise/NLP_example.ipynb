    "For \"Apple\"/\"apple\" case simple capitalization, presence of a possessive, could be the main discriminants. To do better one could look at nearby words (e.g., \"software\" and \"computer\" hint one way, while \"flavor\" hints the other).

Cleaning can also include things like __stemming__ or __lemmatizing__ (identifying similar words like \"computer\" and \"computers\" to their stem).\n",
    "  2. We need to extract __features__.  We're going to think of our input as a sentence, and try to develop features of that sentence.  In this example application, I try to use:\n",
    "   - Capitalized of the word apple? (_a_pple vs _A_pple)    \n",
    "   - Pluralization of the word apple? (apples)\n",
    "   - Possessive form of the word apple? (Apple's)\n",
    "   - Presence (or frequency) of certain well-chosen words : Does (e.g.,) the word \"computer\" or \"fruit\" occur in the sentence?  (This feature regards the sentence as a simple __bag of words__ without regard to trying to parse its structure.)\n",
    "   - In addition to single words, I also try looking for __n-grams__: Strings of n consecutive words.\n",
    "   - There are common techniques for determining which words / n-grams to look for.  One of them is called __tf-idf__.\n",
    "  3. Finally, run some sort of classifier on the features.\n",

    "\n",
    "When doing \"bag of words\" type techniques on a *large* corpus and without an existing vocabulary, there is a simple trick that can often be useful.  The issue (and solution) is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    " - The output is a feature vector, so that whenever we encounter a word we must look up which coordinate slot it is in.  A naive way would be to keep a list of all the words encoutered so far, and look up each word when it is encountered.  Whenever we encounter a new word, we see if we've already seen it before and if not -- assign it a new number.  This requires storing all the words that we have seen in memory, cannot be done in parallel (because we'd have to share the hash-table of seen words), etc.\n",
    " - A **hash function** takes as input something complicated (like a string) and spits out a number, with the desired property being that different inputs *usually* produce different outputs.  (This is how hash tables are implemented, as the name suggests.)\n",
    " - So -- rather than exactly looking up the coordinate of a given word, we can just use its hash value (modulo a big size that we choose).  This is fast and parallelizes easily.  (There are some downsides: You cannot tell, after the fact, what word each of your feature actually corresponds to!)\n",
    " \n",
    "Scikit-learn includes `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer` to do this.  It behaves as almost a drop-in replacement for `CountVectorizer`.  It can be used with tf-idf by combining it with the `TfidfTransformer` (the `TfidfVectorizer` is the `CountVectorizer` together with the `TfidfTransformer`). For our application (where the training and test data is small), we may as well just use `TfidfVectorizer` -- but it is good to know that `HashingVectorizer` is there."
